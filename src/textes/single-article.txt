GRID INFRASTRUCTURE

The Conversation: The old, dirty, creaky US electric grid would cost $5 trillion to replace. Where should infrastructure spending go?

The local It: Italy has already surpassed its renewable energy target for 2020

The figure had reached 17.5 percent by the end of 2015, Eurostat said, putting the country ahead of its target for 2020 five years early. That was almost triple the figure of 6.3 percent in 2004.  

The New York Times: Solar Experiment Lets Neighbors Trade Energy Among Themselves

…In a promising experiment in an affluent swath of the borough, dozens of solar-panel arrays spread across rowhouse rooftops are wired into a growing network. Called the Brooklyn Microgrid, the project is signing up residents and businesses to a virtual trading platform that will allow solar-energy producers to sell excess-electricity credits from their systems to buyers in the group, who may live as close as next door…
